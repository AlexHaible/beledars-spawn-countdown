# Beledar's Spawn Countdown Timer

This is a simple countdown timer for the spawn of the Beledar's Spawn rare mob in the Hallowfall zone of World of Warcraft: The War Within.

## Usage

Simply add the action to your Stream Deck like you would any other action. It'll show the time remaining until the next spawn of Beledar's Spawn.
When the timer reaches 0, the action will show "Event Started" instead of the time remaining. After 10 seconds, it will revert back to showing the time remaining.

## Configuration

Select the action in the Stream Deck software and select which region you're in. The timer will automatically adjust to the correct spawn time based on the region you select.
Currently only EU and NA are supported. If no region is selected, it will default to EU.

## Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/AlexHaible/beledars-spawn-countdown/releases) page.
2. Install the plugin by double-clicking the downloaded file.
